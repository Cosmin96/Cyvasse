1)For getting the project initially:
git clone https://github.com/Cosmin96/Cyvasse

2)For pulling commits from Github:

git pull origin master

3)For pushing commits to the repo:

git add .
git commit -m "Write a clear and brief message to let others know what the commit is about"
git push origin master

4)For mergin commits on the repo:
git add .
git commit -m "Write a clear and brief message to let others know what the commit is about"
git pull origin master(pull before pushing. might give a merge error that has to be fixed...let's hope not)
git push origin master

That's all for now!
